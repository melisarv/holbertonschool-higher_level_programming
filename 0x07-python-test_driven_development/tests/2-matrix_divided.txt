This is a doctest based regression suite for 2-matrix_divided.txt
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

>>> print(matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 3))
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

>>> print(matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 'Holbie'))
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: div must be a number

>>> print(matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 9.99))
[[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6]]
