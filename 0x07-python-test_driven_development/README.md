# Project: 0x07-python-test_driven_development

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.

In this project you will find the files with solved cases to understand Python programming, interactive test, write Docstrings to create tests, write documentation for each module and function, basic option flags to create test and how to find edges cases.

## Requirements
## Python Scripts
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* All files should end with a new line
* The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* The code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.)
* All files must be executable

## Python Test Cases
* All files should end with a new line
* All files should be inside a folder tests
* All files should be text file

## Files - Functions

* 0-add_integer.py, tests/0-add_integer.txt - function that adds 2 integers
* 2-matrix_divided.py, tests/2-matrix_divided.txt - function that divides all elements of a matrix
* 3-say_my_name.py, tests/3-say_my_name.txt - function that prints My name is
* 4-print_square.py, tests/4-print_square.txt - function that prints a square with the character #
* 5-text_indentation.py, tests/5-text_indentation.txt - prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters:., ?, :
* tests/6-max_integer_test.py - unittests for the function def max_integer(list=[])
