# Project: 0x03-python-data_structures

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.

In this project you will find the files with solved cases to understand Python programming: list, tuples and squence.

## Requirements
## Python Scripts
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* All files should end with a new line
* The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* The code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.)
* All files must be executable

## C
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall - Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All files should end with a new line
* It is not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit.
* The prototypes of all the functions should be included in the header file called lists.h

## Compilation

Your code will be compiled this way:

chmod u+x [file name]

## Execution

./[object file name]

## Examples

chmod u+x 0-add.py

./0-add.py

## Functions

* lists.h - header file
* 0-print_list_integer.py - prints all integers of a list
* 1-element_at.py - retrieves an element from a list like in C
* 2-replace_in_list.py - replaces an element of a list at a specific position
* 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py - prints all integers of a list, in reverse order
* 4-new_in_list.py - replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list
* 5-no_c.py - removes all characters c and C from a string
* 6-print_matrix_integer.py - prints a matrix of integers
* 7-add_tuple.py - adds 2 tuples
* 8-multiple_returns.py - returns aa tuple with the length of a string and its first character
* 9-max_integer.py - finds the biggest integer of a list
* 10-divisible_by_2.py - finds all multiples of 2 in a list
* 11-delete_at.py - deletes the item at a specific position in a list
* 12-switch.py - switch value of a and b
* 13-is_palindrome.c - function in c that checks if a singly list is a palindrome
